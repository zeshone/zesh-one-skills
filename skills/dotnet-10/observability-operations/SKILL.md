## When to Use

- Touching `Program.cs` (Serilog bootstrap/pipeline, health check registration, background service registration).
- Writing or reviewing any `*BackgroundService.cs`, `*HostedService.cs`, or `IHostedService` implementation.
- Defining or registering `Options/**/*Options.cs` / `*Validator.cs` configuration classes.
- Writing log statements inside endpoint handlers, services, or middleware.
- Adding typed `HttpClient` registrations with resilience handlers.
- Adding or changing health check endpoints, OpenAPI/Scalar setup, or `TimeProvider` usage.

## Critical Patterns

### Rule 1 — Do: bootstrap logger before `WebApplication.CreateBuilder`; Don't: start without one

**Why**: if `ValidateOnStart()` or host build fails, no structured output exists without the bootstrap logger.
The bootstrap must use `CompactJsonFormatter` (`Serilog.Formatting.Compact`) at minimum level Warning.

### Rule 2 — Do: call `builder.Host.UseSerilog()` before any `builder.Services.Add*`; Don't: register Serilog after other services

**Why**: DI-resolved services that use `ILogger<T>` receive the Serilog provider from the first resolution.
Serilog is the ONLY logging provider — do not add Microsoft console/debug providers alongside it.

### Rule 3 — Do: `CompactJsonFormatter` (CLEF) for all sinks; Don't: plain text or unstructured console

**Why**: CLEF is the machine-parseable structured log contract required for log aggregation and querying.
Configure log levels via `LoggerConfiguration`, not `appsettings.json`'s `Logging` section (it is not honored).

### Rule 4 — Do: suppress ASP.NET Core and EF Core noise via `MinimumLevel.Override`; Don't: leave default Info level

**Why**: without `Override("Microsoft.AspNetCore", Warning)` and `Override("Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command", Warning)`, every request and every SQL query emits an Info event. Revert debug-level overrides before commit.

### Rule 5 — Do: `UseSerilogRequestLogging()` before endpoint routing, enriched with user subject + remote IP; Don't: rely on ASP.NET Core default request logging

**Why**: the default pipeline emits two non-CLEF events per request and breaks structured correlation. Place the middleware before routing so timing covers full handler execution. Never enrich with `PasswordHash`, `TotpSecret`, raw key material, session tokens, or any sensitive field.

**Exception:** placement may be moved before the rate-limiting middleware if you need to log rate-limit (429) outcomes — document the deviation with a comment at the call site. The canonical pipeline order is owned by the api-rest-minimal-apis skill.

### Rule 6 — Do: inject `ILogger<T>` via DI; Don't: use static `Log.Logger` directly

**Why**: static logger bypasses DI lifetime control and makes testing harder. Use `[LoggerMessage]` source generation on high-frequency hot paths; standard `logger.LogInformation(...)` is acceptable for low-frequency calls.

### Rule 7 — Do: named message template placeholders; Don't: string interpolation in log calls

**Why**: `logger.LogInformation("User {UserId} authenticated", userId)` captures a queryable structured field.
`$"User {userId} authenticated"` destroys structured capture and cannot be queried by field.

### Rule 8 — Do: NEVER log sensitive fields; no exceptions

**Why**: `PasswordHash`, `TotpSecret`, raw JWT private key, KEK values, SHA-256 token hashes, and session identifiers must be explicitly excluded from log scopes, enrichers, and diagnostic contexts. Security audit must cover log output, not just API responses.

### Rule 9 — Do: treat OpenTelemetry adoption as a deliberate, documented decision; Don't: bolt on telemetry packages ad hoc

**Why**: Serilog is the logging backbone of this stack. OpenTelemetry (traces/metrics) is the standard .NET observability option and is the recommended choice when distributed tracing or metrics are needed — adopt it as a deliberate decision, keep the instrumentation AOT/trimming-safe, and document the telemetry posture either way (what is collected, what is deliberately excluded) in the architecture notes.

### Rule 10 — Do: separate `/health/live` (tag `"live"`) and `/health/ready` (tag `"ready"`); Don't: mix liveness and readiness in one endpoint

**Why**: liveness is a self-check; readiness must verify every registered `DbContext` and each critical external dependency the project actually has — add Redis, queue, or external URL checks only when those dependencies exist. Detailed JSON health responses (check names, durations) must be gated behind an admin-level authorization policy; unauthenticated routes return the status string only.

### Rule 11 — Do: `IOptions<T>` as the default; escalate only when required

**Why**: `IOptions<T>` covers all configuration that does not change at runtime (JWT, Argon2, TOTP, connection metadata). Use `IOptionsSnapshot<T>` only for per-request reload; `IOptionsMonitor<T>` only for live `OnChange` notifications.

### Rule 12 — Do: `const string Section` property on every Options class; Don't: magic strings at registration

**Why**: self-documents `BindConfiguration` call sites and prevents binding path drift between registration and configuration files. For the full Options class shape (`const string Section`, `required init` props, `[Required]`/`[Range]`/`[StringLength]`), see the design-patterns skill.

### Rule 13 — Do: `ValidateDataAnnotations().ValidateOnStart()` on every load-bearing option; Don't: omit it without a documented reason

**Why**: options that are load-bearing at startup (JWT key paths, KEK configuration, connection strings, Argon2 parameters) must fail at startup, not on first use. Default to `ValidateOnStart()`; deliberate omission is the documented exception — justify why the defaults are safe with a comment at the registration site, never omit silently.
DataAnnotations (`[Required]`, `[Range]`, `[StringLength]`) are reserved exclusively for Options validation; request validation is hand-rolled through the Result pattern (see `../design-patterns/SKILL.md` and `../dotnet-conventions/SKILL.md`) — FluentValidation is not part of this stack.
Use `IValidateOptions<T>` (registered as singleton) for cross-property or environment-conditional logic that DataAnnotations cannot express.

### Rule 14 — Do: connection strings from environment variables only; Don't: put them in `appsettings*.json`

**Why**: connection strings and cryptographic key material in `appsettings.json` or `appsettings.Production.json` is a security violation regardless of git configuration.

### Rule 15 — Do: `AddHostedService<T>()` for background services; Don't: `AddSingleton<IHostedService, T>()`

**Why**: `AddHostedService` ensures proper `IHostedService` registration and shutdown ordering.

### Rule 16 — Do: inject `IServiceScopeFactory` and call `factory.CreateAsyncScope()` per unit of work; Don't: inject scoped services or `IServiceProvider` into the BackgroundService constructor

**Why**: `BackgroundService` is singleton-lifetime. Injecting a `DbContext` or any other scoped service via constructor creates a captive dependency. Create a scope per unit of work and dispose it when the work completes. See the performance skill for the DI-lifetime rule.

### Rule 17 — Do: propagate `stoppingToken` through every `await` inside `ExecuteAsync`; Don't: ignore or swallow cancellation

**Why**: loops that do not pass `CancellationToken` prevent clean shutdown. Handle `OperationCanceledException` by logging at Debug/Information level and returning — never swallow it.

### Rule 18 — Do: log unhandled exceptions at Error level and continue the loop; Don't: let exceptions crash the service or swallow them silently

**Why**: a crashed background service cannot recover without a process restart. Log with the exception object and relevant context identifiers (correlation ID, item ID), then continue.

### Rule 19 — Do: `AddStandardResilienceHandler()` for all typed HttpClient registrations; Don't: manual `AddPolicyHandler` chains

**Why**: the standard handler composes rate limiter, total timeout, retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker, and per-attempt timeout in one call. Manual chains of 30+ lines are error-prone and miss the composite strategy. Use `AddStandardHedgingHandler()` only for latency-critical idempotent calls; document the idempotency guarantee with a comment.

Customize via the callback overload only when the defaults are demonstrably insufficient for a specific dependency (e.g., disabling auto-retry for non-idempotent calls) — and document why at the registration site.

### Rule 20 — Do: prefer BCL primitives for periodic work and in-process state; Don't: add caching, scheduling, or queuing infrastructure without a documented decision

**Why**: default to `BackgroundService` with `Task.Delay`/`PeriodicTimer` loops for simple periodic work; adopt Quartz.NET or Hangfire only when persistence, cron expressions, or distributed coordination are genuinely required. Caching (`IMemoryCache`/`HybridCache`/`IDistributedCache`) is permitted when justified by a real requirement — every such infrastructure dependency is a deliberate, documented design decision, never a drive-by addition. In-process deduplication uses `ConcurrentDictionary` or a bounded `Channel<T>`.

### Rule 21 — Do: `Channel<T>` (bounded, `FullMode.Wait`) for in-process producer/consumer flows; register as singleton

**Why**: producers (endpoint handlers) write to `ChannelWriter<T>`; consumers (BackgroundService) read via `ReadAllAsync(stoppingToken)`. Catch per-item exceptions inside the consumer loop and log at Error level before continuing.

### Rule 22 — Do: `TimeProvider` singleton for all time-dependent operations; Don't: call `DateTime.UtcNow` directly

**Why**: `FakeTimeProvider` is substituted in tests via conditional registration. Direct `DateTime.UtcNow` calls make time-dependent background service logic untestable.

### Rule 23 — Do: Scalar UI in non-production only; emit `docs/openapi.json` at build time via `Microsoft.Extensions.ApiDescription.Server`; Don't: use Swashbuckle or NSwag

**Why**: Scalar is the recommended OpenAPI UI (replacing Swashbuckle/NSwag). The committed `docs/openapi.json` is the artifact for external consumers; CI must fail if the committed document diverges from the generated one.

## Constraints & Tradeoffs

- Serilog is the SOLE logging provider. No other `ILoggerProvider` implementations alongside it.
- The `Logging` section of `appsettings.json` is inert — Serilog does not honor it; all level overrides go in `LoggerConfiguration`.
- `ValidateOnStart()` defaults to ON for load-bearing options: the startup-latency cost is accepted in exchange for failing fast. Deliberate omissions are documented exceptions at the registration site, never a silent posture.
- `IValidateOptions<T>` adds a singleton registration per Options type; use only when DataAnnotations are insufficient.
- `Channel<T>` with `FullMode.Wait` applies backpressure to producers; size the channel capacity to match expected throughput before production load testing.
- Tracing, caching, queues, and schedulers are deliberate architectural decisions, not defaults — adopt each only with a documented justification, and record deliberate exclusions in the project's architecture notes.

## Anti-Patterns

- Non-CLEF (plain text) log output in production sinks.
- Starting the host without a bootstrap logger (startup exceptions silently lost).
- Enabling both ASP.NET Core default request logging and `UseSerilogRequestLogging` (duplicate events per request).
- Logging `PasswordHash`, `TotpSecret`, JWT private key, KEK values, token hashes, or session identifiers.
- Silently omitting `ValidateOnStart()` on a load-bearing option without a documented reason at the registration site.
- Injecting scoped services into a `BackgroundService` constructor (captive dependency).
- Ignoring or swallowing `OperationCanceledException` inside `ExecuteAsync`.
- Writing manual Polly `AddPolicyHandler` chains instead of `AddStandardResilienceHandler()`.
- Connection strings or key material in any `appsettings*.json` file.
- Adding caching, scheduling, or queuing infrastructure without a documented architectural decision — these are deliberate adoptions, never drive-by dependencies.
- Calling `DateTime.UtcNow` directly instead of injecting `TimeProvider`.
- Using Swashbuckle or NSwag instead of `Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi` + Scalar.
