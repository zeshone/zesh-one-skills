## When to Use

- Writing or reviewing any file under the test project (`*.Tests.csproj`, `**/Tests/**/*.cs`, `**/*Tests.cs`, `**/*Fixture.cs`, `**/*Spy.cs`).
- Adding assertions, fixtures, spies, or test helpers.
- Configuring WebApplicationFactory, Testcontainers, or xUnit collection fixtures.
- Reviewing test coverage decisions or CI test-run behavior.

## Critical Patterns

### Rule 1 — Do: xUnit 2.9.x with native `Assert` only; Don't: add FluentAssertions or Moq

**Why**: FluentAssertions v8+ carries the proprietary Xceed Community License — verify license compatibility before adding it to any codebase. v7 (last Apache 2.0 release) is unmaintained and creates a silent upgrade trap. Moq 4.20.x contained a SponsorLink telemetry/supply-chain incident and is banned regardless of version. The three-tier strategy makes a mocking library architecturally redundant. If mock-generation ever becomes genuinely necessary, prefer NSubstitute (MIT); never Moq. Teams that accept the license-ceiling burden may pin FluentAssertions v7 as a documented exception, but do not use `.Should()` syntax alongside native `Assert` — it creates assertion-style inconsistency and introduces a dependency that must be managed for license compliance.

### Rule 2 — Do: real database (Testcontainers) for any test touching SQL or infrastructure seams; Don't: use EF InMemory as a behavioral substitute

**Why**: InMemory cannot model provider-specific behavior — SQL semantics, constraints, transactions, or session state. A passing InMemory integration test proves nothing about real database behavior and produces false CI green while defects silently rot.
**Permitted InMemory uses (WAF tier only, narrow exception):**
- Assert that DI resolves your DbContext(s) by checking the provider name — never call the DB.
- Assert DI lifetime/type for infrastructure seam interfaces without invoking them.
- Pure EF `IEntityTypeConfiguration` unit tests with zero HTTP or service involvement.

Never issue SQL from these tests; when in doubt, use the real-database tier.

### Rule 3 — Do: never mock a transaction seam; Don't: replace it with stubs in behavioral tests

**Why**: if the project has a transaction or data-access seam, it IS the transaction perimeter. A mocked seam never exercises the real transactional behavior, making the test structurally blind to a critical class of regressions. Test it only against the real-database tier.

### Rule 4 — Do: three-tier strategy; Don't: collapse tiers or substitute a lower tier for a higher one

| Tier | Tool | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | xUnit, no DB | Pure C# logic, mappers, validators with no external dependency |
| WAF | `WebApplicationFactory<Program>` | HTTP contract, middleware, routing, structural DI; real DI + targeted test-double overrides for external services |
| Real DB | Testcontainers with the production database engine (match the production version) | Any test touching SQL, database-specific behavior, transactions, or database-enforced security where present |

The real-database tier name is per-project (e.g., `RealPg` is a common choice for Postgres projects); what matters is that the tier runs against the real engine.

### Rule 5 — Do: `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult` naming; Don't: prose names as the default

**Why**: this is the house naming convention of this skill — it keeps test intent scannable and greppable. Use `[Fact]` for single scenarios, `[Theory]` + `[InlineData]`/`[MemberData]` for parameterized paths. `[Fact(DisplayName = "...")]` is an exception for genuinely prose-friendly scenarios only.

**Exception (requirement traceability):** if the project maps tests to audit or acceptance requirement IDs, the traceability scheme takes precedence over pure naming purity. Preferred form keeps `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult` and moves the ID to a `[Trait("audit","AC-12")]` or category — never drop the link to the requirement.

### Rule 6 — Do: AAA structure with blank-line separators; Don't: interleave setup and assertion

**Why**: shared setup goes in the constructor (xUnit creates a new instance per test) or `IAsyncLifetime.InitializeAsync`. Never use `[SetUp]`/`[TearDown]` — those are MSTest/NUnit attributes.

### Rule 7 — Do: FakeTimeProvider for all time-dependent logic; Don't: use `DateTime.UtcNow` or `DateTimeOffset.UtcNow` in production code or tests

**Why**: production code must inject `TimeProvider` as a singleton so the test host can substitute `FakeTimeProvider` (package: `Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing 10.x`) via the DI override in `WithWebHostBuilder`. This applies to token expiry, JWT key rotation, TOTP windows, and rate-limit boundaries.

### Rule 8 — Do: serial execution when integration tests share a container; Don't: enable parallelism against shared state

**Why**: when integration tests share a single Testcontainers instance per xUnit Collection fixture, parallel execution against the same container causes non-deterministic state collisions — do not add `xunit.runner.json` parallelism settings in that setup. If you instead provision per-test or per-class isolated databases, or use Respawn-style resets, parallelism may be re-enabled as an explicit, documented decision paired with the isolation strategy that makes it safe.

### Rule 9 — Do: hard-fail in CI when Docker is unavailable; Don't: skip real-database tests silently

**Why**: a silently skipped integration test is an invisible regression — especially when the real-database tier is what verifies security invariants. In CI, throw an explicit exception (red build). Locally, use `Xunit.SkippableFact` and `throw new SkipException("Docker not available")` only when Docker is verified absent at runtime.

### Rule 10 — Do: `Assert.IsType<T>` for Result/discriminated union assertions; Don't: cast or assert on protected Failure reason messages

**Why**: assert sealed-record Result union outcomes by type — `Assert.IsType<OrderResult.Failure>(result)` — rather than casting. When a Failure type intentionally carries no reason message as an anti-enumeration measure (typical in auth/login/signup flows), tests must not assert on reason strings — asserting the reason would force the code to violate the invariant.

### Rule 11 — Do: manual hand-rolled spies in `Spies/` or `Fakes/`; Don't: generate spies from a mocking library

**Why**: a boolean was-called flag and a captured-args list are sufficient for most observation needs. Keep spy classes simple. Mocking libraries are redundant given the three-tier strategy.

## Constraints & Tradeoffs

- Recommended baseline test `.csproj` packages: `xunit 2.9.x`, `xunit.runner.visualstudio 3.x` (use current 3.x), `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk 17.x`, `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Testing 10.0.x`, `Testcontainers.PostgreSql 4.4.x` for Postgres — or the Testcontainers module matching your production engine — `Microsoft.Extensions.TimeProvider.Testing 10.x`, `Xunit.SkippableFact`, `coverlet.collector`. Add `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory` only if the narrow WAF-tier DI-wiring exception (Rule 2) genuinely requires it — adding the package reference creates drift risk even with limited intent.
- Coverage targets are integration-weighted, not line-level. Every Minimal API endpoint needs at least one WAF test for HTTP contract. Every security-critical path (auth, TOTP, session revocation) needs at least one real-database test at the real security seam. If the domain layer consists of behavior-free persistence POCOs, do not enforce line-coverage targets (e.g., the generic 85%) on it — that produces coverage noise, not confidence. If domain entities carry behavior, domain coverage targets apply normally.
- Serial execution is the default WHEN integration tests share one container (Rule 8). Any switch to parallelism must be documented together with the per-test isolation strategy that makes it safe.
- Applicability: the no-mocking-library and no-EF-InMemory rules are strongest when the database enforces security-relevant invariants (constraints, checks, triggers) — there, real-database testing is non-negotiable. In projects without database-enforced security, these defaults still reflect this skill's style but may be relaxed via explicit architectural review.
- Connection strings are injected via `ConfigureAppConfiguration` from the Testcontainers-provided string. Never hard-code database credentials in test code.
- If the project uses a transaction/unit-of-work seam that forbids nested transactions, never nest its calls in tests — each test action enters its own context, or the fixture provides one.

## Anti-Patterns

- `UseInMemoryDatabase` as an integration/behavioral test substitute.
- Mocking the transaction/security-context seam in behavioral tests.
- Adding Moq (banned — SponsorLink incident, supply-chain risk).
- Adding FluentAssertions v8+ (proprietary Xceed license) or even v7 (unmaintained, license-ceiling trap) without a documented license review.
- Using `.Should()` assertion syntax in the test project.
- Silently skipping real-database (Testcontainers) tests in CI when Docker is unavailable.
- Enabling test parallelism while integration tests share one container.
- Asserting on `Failure` reason strings where the no-reason invariant is an intentional anti-enumeration measure (auth flows).
- Enforcing line-coverage targets on a behavior-free persistence-POCO domain layer — it produces coverage noise, not confidence.
- Hard-coding connection strings or database credentials.
- Nesting calls into a transaction seam that forbids nested transactions inside a test already running in that seam's context.

## Progressive Disclosure

1. **First**: read `Critical Patterns` — operational defaults.
2. **On package or library decisions**: check `Constraints & Tradeoffs` for the recommended baseline versions.
3. **On real-database fixture setup**: R8 (fixture lifecycle and parallelism) and R9 (Docker/CI) together cover the container setup contract.
4. **On coverage questions**: the coverage rule is in `Constraints & Tradeoffs` — lead with integration weight, not a blanket line-coverage target.
5. **If neighboring domains are touched**: follow `Resources`.
