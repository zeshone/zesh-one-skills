## Applicability Gate (Mandatory)

Use this gate BEFORE applying any rule in this skill.

### Applies when

- The project needs client global/shared UI state management.
- The project does **not** use Redux as an existing legacy state-management standard.

### Does NOT apply when

- The project already uses Redux as a legacy standard.
- There is an attempt to introduce Zustand into a Redux legacy codebase without an approved architectural migration plan.

### Required behavior when it does NOT apply

- Return: **"not applicable"**.
- Respect existing Redux legacy architecture.
- Do **not** force migration, parallel adoption, or coexistence by default.

### Governance Decision Enforced

- No coexistence of state-management packages by default.
- Zustand is the standard only when Redux is not already the legacy standard.
- If Redux legacy exists, this `zustand-5` skill is out of scope.

## When to Use

Load this skill when designing global client state, selector usage, async actions, or persisted feature state with Zustand 5.

## Critical Patterns

1. **Do** create one store per feature/domain; **don't** centralize all app state in a mega-store. **Why:** limits coupling and rerender radius.
2. **Do** use selectors for every component read; **don't** subscribe to the whole store object. **Why:** prevents broad invalidations.
3. **Do** use `useShallow` for object/tuple multi-selectors; **don't** return new object literals unguarded. **Why:** avoids avoidable rerenders.
4. **Do** import `useShallow` from `zustand/react/shallow`; **don't** use v4 path `zustand/shallow`. **Why:** Zustand 5 compatibility.
5. **Do** keep async actions in feature action modules; **don't** embed transport/service details directly in UI components. **Why:** separation of concerns.
6. **Do** expose explicit loading/error flags in async store actions; **don't** hide request lifecycle in implicit side effects. **Why:** deterministic UI states.
7. **Do** prefer local `useState` for component-local state; **don't** globalize ephemeral UI toggles by default. **Why:** reduces store complexity.
8. **Do** keep server/API state outside Zustand; **don't** use Zustand as remote cache. **Why:** server state belongs to TanStack Query and has different invalidation/lifecycle semantics.
9. **Do** use `persist` only for state with clear rehydration value; **don't** persist volatile or sensitive transient data. **Why:** storage correctness and security.
10. **Do** namespace persist keys with app/feature prefix; **don't** use generic keys (`settings`, `store`). **Why:** collision prevention.
11. **Do** follow this skill's current Zustand 5 patterns; **don't** use legacy/deprecated APIs from older Zustand versions; **do** verify exact-version syntax/examples/definitions in Context7 before version-sensitive store changes. **Why:** avoids stale imports and API drift.

```typescript
import { useShallow } from "zustand/react/shallow";

const { name, email } = useUserStore(
  useShallow((state) => ({ name: state.name, email: state.email }))
);
```

## Constraints & Tradeoffs

- Fine-grained selectors improve performance but require selector discipline in every component.
- Feature-scoped stores reduce coupling, but can require orchestration for cross-feature workflows.
- Persisted state improves UX continuity, yet introduces versioning/migration responsibilities.
- Middleware improves ergonomics, but each layer increases cognitive and runtime cost.
- Async action abstraction simplifies UI, while adding an architectural boundary to maintain.

Store review checklist:
- Ensure each component subscribes only to required state slices.
- Ensure async store actions expose explicit loading and error state.
- Ensure persisted keys are namespaced and migration-safe.
- Ensure local-only UI state remains outside global stores.
- Ensure middleware stack has clear, documented purpose.

Performance notes:
- Measure rerenders in React DevTools before and after selector changes.
- Prefer scalar selectors in hot paths over broad object selections.
- Normalize store shape when deep updates become frequent.

## Anti-Patterns

1. `const store = useStore()` in render paths that only need one field.
2. Shared monolithic store for unrelated domains.
3. Persisting tokens/session-like secrets directly in browser storage.
4. Using outdated v4 `useShallow` import path in v5 projects.
5. Calling API clients directly inside many components instead of central actions.
6. Returning new arrays/objects in selectors without shallow guards.
7. Persisting loading or error flags that should reset per session.
8. Mixing Redux and Zustand in the same project without an approved architectural plan.

## Quick Pre-Merge Verification Checklist

- [ ] Applicability gate executed and documented (applies vs not applicable).
- [ ] If Redux legacy exists, result is **not applicable** and no forced migration was introduced.
- [ ] Store layout is per-feature/domain (no monolithic store).
- [ ] Components read state through selectors only (no full-store subscription in render paths).
- [ ] `useShallow` imports use `zustand/react/shallow` (v5 path).
- [ ] Zustand is not being used for server/API state; TanStack Query handles remote data.
- [ ] Persist usage is justified, safe, and key names are namespaced.

## Progressive Disclosure

1. Confirm installed Zustand version and check Context7 exact-version docs before API-sensitive store refactors.
2. Start with per-feature stores plus scalar selectors.
3. Add `useShallow` where multi-field selection is required.
4. Move async workflows into feature actions and surface loading/error flags.
5. Add persistence only to user-preference state with namespaced keys.
6. Align store usage with React boundaries from [../react-19/SKILL.md](../react-19/SKILL.md).

Adoption maturity model:
- **Stage 1**: domain stores + scalar selectors.
- **Stage 2**: shallow multi-selectors and action extraction.
- **Stage 3**: controlled persistence with key governance.
- **Stage 4**: middleware tuning with performance profiling.

Execution checkpoints:
- Add selector-level tests for critical derived state behavior.
- Validate hydration behavior for each persisted field after app reload.
- Document migration policy when persisted schema changes.
