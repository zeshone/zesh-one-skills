## When to Use

Use this skill as the default contract when writing or reviewing frontend TypeScript:

- Feature/domain models and API response/request shapes.
- UI props and state typing.
- Shared utilities (mapped/conditional/generic types).
- Refactors where implicit inference is hiding risk.
- Reviewing pull requests that introduce `any`, broad casts, or duplicated model definitions.

## Critical Patterns

1) **DO make public function signatures explicit; DON'T rely on inferred return types for exported APIs.** Why: prevents accidental contract drift.

2) **DO use `unknown` + narrowing for untrusted inputs; DON'T introduce new `any` in PRs.** Why: preserves type safety at boundaries.

   - **PR-blocking rule**: new `any` blocks merge unless there is a documented temporary waiver (reason, owner, expiration date).

3) **DO prefer schema-first inference (`z.infer`) when a Zod schema exists; DON'T duplicate parallel interfaces/types.** Why: one source of truth.

   - **Single-source rule**: if a Zod schema exists, that schema is the single source of truth for that contract's types.

4) **DO use utility types (`Pick`, `Omit`, `Partial`, `Readonly`, `Record`) for derivations; DON'T copy/paste near-identical models.** Why: reduces drift.

5) **DO use `import type` for type-only imports; DON'T import runtime values by mistake.** Why: cleaner bundles and clearer intent.

6) **DO model finite domains via const maps/const types + extracted unions; DON'T handwrite raw repeated string unions across files.** Why: centralizes allowed values.

   - Prefer `as const` domain maps as canonical literals and derive unions from them.

7) **DO keep interfaces/composed types readable and shallow; DON'T inline deep anonymous object trees in exported contracts.** Why: improves reviewability and reuse.

8) **DO prefer discriminated unions for variant payloads; DON'T rely on optional-property guessing.** Why: gives exhaustive narrowing.

9) **DO annotate async function return types (`Promise<T>`); DON'T leak implicit `Promise<any>`.** Why: protects call sites.

10) **DO follow this skill's current TypeScript patterns; DON'T rely on legacy/deprecated syntax or older compiler-era practices; DO verify exact-version syntax/examples/definitions in Context7 before version-sensitive typing changes.** Why: keeps contracts aligned with current TS behavior.

```typescript
const STATUS = {
  ACTIVE: "active",
  INACTIVE: "inactive",
  PENDING: "pending",
} as const;

type Status = (typeof STATUS)[keyof typeof STATUS];
```

## Constraints & Tradeoffs

- Explicit typing increases verbosity, but pays off during refactors and API changes.
- Schema-driven typing reduces duplication, but schema ownership must be clear to avoid circular dependencies.
- Utility types reduce maintenance, but over-composition can hurt readability if stacked excessively.
- Strict no-`any` policy improves safety, but may require incremental `unknown` narrowing wrappers for third-party data.
- Exhaustiveness checks improve robustness, but require consistent discriminants in domain models.
- Explicit contracts on exports may require extra upfront type aliases, but they reduce downstream breaking changes.
- Heavy generic abstractions can look elegant but slow onboarding; prefer clarity over type-level cleverness.

## Exception Policy

- **When it is allowed**: only at boundaries with external libraries lacking adequate types, or in blocking incremental migrations.
- **How to document it**: add an inline code comment and PR note including technical reason, scope, responsible owner, and removal plan.
- **Mandatory expiration**: every exception must include an explicit expiration date; once expired, it is treated as overdue debt and blocks merge until resolved or renewed with new justification.

## Pre-merge Checklist

- [ ] No new `any` was introduced, or there is a complete temporary waiver with expiration.
- [ ] Every Zod-backed contract uses schema-first typing (`z.infer`) as the single source of truth.
- [ ] Finite domains are modeled with const maps/const types (`as const`) and derived unions.
- [ ] Exported APIs have explicit signatures (including `Promise<T>` for async functions).
- [ ] Untrusted inputs use `unknown` + narrowing, with no unsafe casts.
- [ ] There are no duplicated raw literal unions across files.
- [ ] Derived types use utility types instead of manual duplication.

## Anti-Patterns

- Exporting inferred types from implementation details without explicit contracts.
- Using `as any` to bypass compile errors instead of narrowing or redesigning types.
- Maintaining separate manual types for data already defined by runtime schemas.
- Repeating string literal unions across components instead of shared const-map derivation.
- Deeply nested inline object types in props that should be extracted and named.
- Default switch branches that swallow newly introduced variants.

## Progressive Disclosure

1. Confirm installed TypeScript version and check Context7 exact-version docs before syntax/typing-sensitive changes.
2. Start with explicit public contracts and `unknown` at boundaries.
3. Apply schema-driven inference where schemas exist.
4. Refactor repetitive models using utility types.
5. Introduce discriminated unions for variant behaviors.
6. Add exhaustiveness checks in high-risk state transitions.
7. Deepen with framework-specific defaults in [../react-19/SKILL.md](../react-19/SKILL.md) and schema alignment in [../zod-4/SKILL.md](../zod-4/SKILL.md).
