## When to Use

Load this skill when creating React 19 UI units that require component boundary decisions (`server` vs `client`), form actions, async reads, or ref forwarding replacements.

## Critical Patterns

1. **Do** default to Server Components; **don't** add `"use client"` by habit. **Why:** keeps bundles smaller.
2. **Do** add `"use client"` only for state, events, refs, or browser APIs; **don't** use it for static render-only views. **Why:** client boundaries are expensive.
3. **Do** verify React Compiler activation before removing memoization; **don't** strip `useMemo`/`useCallback` blindly. **Why:** non-compiled apps can regress.
4. **Do** use named React imports; **don't** use default `React` import. **Why:** aligns with modern JSX runtime and linting.
5. **Do** use `useActionState` for form action status; **don't** use removed `useFormState`. **Why:** React 19 API compatibility.
6. **Do** treat `ref` as a prop in new components; **don't** introduce `forwardRef` for React 19-first code. **Why:** simpler component signatures.
7. **Do** use `use()` for promise reads within Suspense; **don't** re-implement loading orchestration manually. **Why:** native async read semantics.
8. **Do** keep `use()` reads close to render usage; **don't** pass unresolved promises across deep trees without boundaries. **Why:** improves failure locality.
9. **Do** model form actions as idempotent server mutations; **don't** rely only on client-side optimistic assumptions. **Why:** prevents divergence.
10. **Do** re-check hook behavior after compiler/tooling upgrades; **don't** assume past heuristics still hold. **Why:** compiler/runtime contracts evolve.

```typescript
import { useActionState } from "react";

export function ProfileForm() {
  const [state, action, isPending] = useActionState(saveProfileAction, null);
  return <form action={action}><button disabled={isPending}>{isPending ? "Saving..." : "Save"}</button></form>;
}
```

## Constraints & Tradeoffs

- Server-first composition improves performance but can constrain direct browser API access.
- React Compiler reduces manual memo work, but only when explicitly enabled in tooling.
- `use()` improves async ergonomics yet requires clear Suspense/error boundary strategy.
- `ref` as prop simplifies new code, but migration may coexist with legacy `forwardRef` wrappers.
- Form action flows centralize mutation handling, but can feel indirect versus inline handlers.

Boundary decision checklist:
- Mark as server by default, then justify each client boundary.
- Confirm compiler status before deleting memoization primitives.
- Ensure every `use()` path has surrounding Suspense and error boundaries.
- Keep form pending and result handling colocated with action usage.
- Avoid mixed legacy/new ref patterns unless migration demands coexistence.

Compiler activation hints:
- Next.js: verify `experimental.reactCompiler` before cleanup refactors.
- Non-Next bundlers: verify compiler plugin wiring in Babel/toolchain.
- Treat compiler status as environment-specific, not repository-wide by assumption.

## Anti-Patterns

1. Client-marking entire trees because one child uses events.
2. Replacing `useActionState` with ad-hoc pending booleans per form.
3. Removing memoization without confirming compiler enablement.
4. Using `use()` outside controlled Suspense/error boundaries.
5. Mixing legacy and modern ref patterns in the same component without intent.
6. Importing broad client-only libraries into server component entry points.
7. Converting server components to client components only to run simple formatting logic.

## Progressive Disclosure

1. Adopt server-vs-client boundary discipline first.
2. Move forms to `useActionState` and explicit pending UX.
3. Introduce `use()` for async reads where Suspense already exists.
4. Enable and validate React Compiler before memo simplification passes.
5. Cross-check app-level integration with [../nextjs-15/SKILL.md](../nextjs-15/SKILL.md).

Team rollout pattern:
- **Phase 1**: boundary rules + import hygiene.
- **Phase 2**: forms migrated to action-based flow.
- **Phase 3**: selective `use()` adoption in high-impact async reads.
- **Phase 4**: compiler-enabled optimization cleanup.

Execution guardrails:
- Keep one concern per component boundary refactor PR.
- Validate behavior snapshots before and after client/server boundary changes.
- Prefer incremental migration over whole-tree rewrites.
